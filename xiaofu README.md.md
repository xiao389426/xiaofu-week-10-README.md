# definition

>A**convolutional neural network** is a special type of *artificial neural network*that uses a mathematical operation called convolution in at least one of its layers instead of the common matrix multiplication. They are specifically designed to handle pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing.

**A convolutional neural network consists of ：**

1.input layer

2.hidden layer

3.output layer

A typical CNN consists of 3 parts: from [How do Convolutional Neural Networks work?](https://brohrer.mcknote.com/zh-Hant/how_machine_learning_works/how_convolutional_neural_networks_work.html)

- convolutional layer
* pooling layer
+ fully connected layer

| convolutional layer| pooling layer | fully connected layer |
| --- | --- | --- |
